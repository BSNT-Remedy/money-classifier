    <h1>Ethics Statement</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>1. Responsible Use</h2>
    <p>
        This machine learning model is an educational prototype. 
        Users must be aware that predictions are not guaranteed to be accurate, 
        and the application should not be used for real-world financial decisions or authentication.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Transparency</h2>
    <p>
        The system displays both prediction labels and confidence scores to ensure transparency. 
        Users can view their aggregated analytics to better understand how the model behaves over time.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Uploaded or captured images are used solely for generating model predictions. 
        The application only stores:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The predicted label</li>
        <li>The confidence score</li>
        <li>The associated user account (if logged in)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        No raw images or personal biometric data are stored on the server.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Prediction history is used for analytics purposes within the app. 
        This allows users and administrators to understand usage patterns and model performance.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitations and Bias</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The model may exhibit bias due to the limited dataset used for training.</li>
        <li>Environmental factors such as lighting or camera quality may affect predictions.</li>
        <li>Results should not be interpreted as absolute truth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Safety</h2>
    <p>
        The app avoids making harmful or misleading claims. It is the user's responsibility 
        to ensure they do not rely on the model for sensitive or high-risk applications.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Commitments</h2>
    <p>
        The developers are committed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improving accuracy responsibly</li>
        <li>Maintaining transparency on how predictions are made</li>
        <li>Ensuring the model remains an educational tool</li>
        <li>Preventing misuse or misinterpretation</li>
    </ul>
